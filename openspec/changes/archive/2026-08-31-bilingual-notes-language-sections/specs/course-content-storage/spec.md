## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Lesson notes bodies carry explicit language sections

A lesson `readme.md` that presents its content in more than one language SHALL mark each
language with a level-2 heading naming that language (for example `## Español` and
`## English`), placed after the lesson's `#` title heading. All of that language's content —
descriptive sub-headings, paragraphs, lists, blockquotes, examples — SHALL live beneath its
language heading, nested at `###` or deeper.

This shape is what the Lesson Page's Notes tab reads to render its "Español" / "English"
columns (see `cinema-lesson-view`). Notes bodies SHALL NOT rely on paragraph ordering or on a
particular number of blank-line-separated blocks to convey which language a passage is in.

A lesson whose notes exist in a single language SHALL still mark that language with its own
level-2 heading, so a monolingual lesson is explicit rather than merely ambiguous.

#### Scenario: A bilingual lesson body is structured by language

- **WHEN** a lesson's `readme.md` presents the same lesson in Spanish and in English
- **THEN** the body carries a `## Español` section and a `## English` section, each holding that language's sub-headings, paragraphs and lists

#### Scenario: A monolingual lesson body still names its language

- **WHEN** a lesson's `readme.md` presents content in English only
- **THEN** the body carries a single `## English` section rather than bare paragraphs under the title

#### Scenario: Reformatting a notes body leaves the title heading untouched

- **WHEN** a lesson's `readme.md` body is restructured into language sections
- **THEN** the file's first `#` heading is unchanged byte-for-byte, so lesson-title derivation for allowlisted modules and the generated `seed-content.ts` are unaffected
